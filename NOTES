Idioms for protecting escape sequences:
    bash:   '\[...\]'
    zsh:    '%{...%}'
    ksh:    (unnecessary: smart counting)

ksh88 may not support command substitution... perhaps a workaround can be made
to work /within/ parameter expansion?

Apparently, some terminal types have "status lines". Consider using status
lines for the job lists when they are available.

Consider supporting fallback on setf if setaf is unavailable.
